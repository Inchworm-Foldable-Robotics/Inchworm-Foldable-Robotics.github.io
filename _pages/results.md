*Figure 2. Experimental data of the inchworm at a period of 2 seconds. As can be seen, some of the data got distorted during tracking. This has been taken into account and will not affect analysis*

**Discussion prompts (fill in as short paragraphs):**

* **Qualitative agreement:**

  * TODO: Describe whether the general trend (increasing, decreasing, peak) is consistent between simulation and experiment.
* **Quantitative differences:**

  * TODO: Note approximate percentage differences at key parameter values.
* **Failure modes / anomalies:**

  * As it can be clearly seen in the simulation videos, the simulated inchworm tends to fail at higher frequencies of gait. The robot actually appears to 'walk' in the wrong axis, going in the y direction, instead of the x.
